                    <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>Amazon</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>

                        <p>Amazon uses the rule of thirds in their design of the layout of their website. This is done but a grid that cuts the landing page into thirds. The grid has nine even boxes.</p>
                        <p>"Amazons homepage uses the rule of thirds to a T. At the top of their homepage to the middle of the page, they use nine
                            even boxes with text and content. Towards the middle of the page, they have a horizontal wide box for rotating, smaller images. Then towards the end of the page, they rotate
                            one line of three even boxes with one line of the horizontal wide box. Another three boxes, one line of the horizontal box, and you reach the end of their webpage."</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Repetition</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>YouTube</span>
                            <p>
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/">youtube.com</a>
                            </p>
                            <img src="images/youtube.jpg" alt="YouTube.jpg">
                            <p>YouTube has a general layout that allows users to find content easier with the repetitive layout that can be clicked on to the link. It displays a grid of four that makes 
                                the viewer about to read what is on the site.</p><p>Repitition makes having a lot of content in one place easier to navigate through. This makes reusing elements, such as color, patterns
                                fonts, textures in this case boxes, and much more to be used consistently. </p>

                        <span>Tapas Marketing</span>
                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://tapasmarketing.com/">tapasmarketing.com</a>

                        <img src="images/tapasmarketing.jpg" alt="Tapas Marketing.jpg">
                        <p>Tapas Marketing is a website that I designed. I wanted to show the contrasting colors used that allows the reader to visual scan through the page and see the content.
                        </p><p>Contrast is not only colors it can also be typography, weight, positioning of images and text. This helps with the flow of the content and for the eye to see at a glance what
                        is important.</p>
